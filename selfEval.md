# Self Evaluation

1. Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
* Today has been the best day for me in terms of time management so far, but there were also fewer assignments. So either my attempts to correctly budget are getting smarter with experience or I'm just being more realistic about adding an additional hour on to every assignment in my head. I don't have much advice other than it's better to overestimate than underestimate, and that I hope they're trying to take at least a few little breaks throughout the day. 
2. How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
* Does this five year old know what a computer is? I hope so. Functions ready an action and tell you how to do the action so that you can choose to do the action any time, as many times as you'd like. Imagine baking a cake -- first you have to read the recipe (declare the function and parameters), then combine all of the ingredients (write the code block) and then you have to actually bake it (call the function).
3. Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
* Parameters tell a function what kind of data to expect (e.g. a string, a number, etc.), and arguments introduce any of the data that will be necessary to successfully call the function. 
4. What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
* I'm assuming that a lot of these examples of functions aren't realistic, in that these aren't typical use cases for this type of tool. Does anyone know what a typical use case might actually be?
